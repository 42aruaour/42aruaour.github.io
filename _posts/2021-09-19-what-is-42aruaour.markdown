## Who is 42aruaour?

Who indeed? I have no clue. Probably just some random netizen.

## What is 42aruaour?

Not a weeb. Definitely not an alias or anything. Everybody asks "What is 42aruaour?" but nobody asks "How is 42aruaour?" *sad*.

## Where is 42aruaour?

<span class="jp">どこか分からないよ～。</span>

## When is 42aruaour?

I don't know? Never? Good question.

## Why is 42aruaour?

Why not? They probably self identify as one, whatever that is.

## How is 42aruaour?

"A 7/10, but 9/10 with chocolate milk" - some random other dude.

## How do you pronounce 42aruaour?

I normally use katakana to help with this problem by saying the text part is similar to trying to say <span class="jp">アルアオル</span>, but it turns out that Google Translate is surprisingly accurate here.

Random crap, languages, and all sorts of other, "less interesting" stuff is going to be the content of this website. Also maybe some useful stuff every so often lol.
